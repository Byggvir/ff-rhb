Gluon site configuration for Rheinbach (ff-rhb) with USB-support

This site configuration is based on the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis site configuration for Gluon. It starts into operation mode after installation and contains a publix ssh keys for remote maintanance.

##gluon

For public use only a stable branch is released. It contains a public ssh keys for remote access. After installation the router boots into "operation mode". For "setup mode" press the RESET button for ~ 8 seconds.

You may leave or delete the public ssh-key after installation. It's in the firmware for my convinience because it makes installing nodes easier.

## mesh

This site configuration uses only 802.11s for meshing by default. The ibss network is defined but disabled.
