Gluon site configuration for Rheinbach (ff-rhb) 

This site configuration is based on the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis site configuration for Gluon.

The master branch should only be used for experimental purpose to build the latest firmware.

For stable firmwar releases use the branch which correponds with teh Gluon Versieon. Example use v2016.2 to build a Gluon v2016.2.

For USB-Support use the branch *-usb.
