# ff-rhb
Gluon v2016.2 stable site configuration for Rheinbach, NRW (ff-rhb), with USB support for storage, net, pci and umts

This site configuration is based on the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis site configuration for Gluon.

##gluon
The gluon master branch is used for this experimental firmware until gluon v2016.3 will be released.

##gluon branches

###stable

For public use only a stable branch is released. It contains a public ssh keys for remote access. After installation the router boots into "operation mode". For "setup mode" press the RESET button for ~ 8 seconds.

You may leave or delete the public ssh-key after installation. Its there for my convinience because it makes installing nodes easier.


## mesh

This site configuration uses only 802.11s for meshing by default. The ibss network is defined but disabled.
